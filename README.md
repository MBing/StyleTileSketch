# Sketch Style Tile Basic Template

As I was unable to find a proper basic style tile
and my students [@Thinkful](http://www.thinkful.com) were in need
of a basic Sketch example iso the Adobe Photoshop one.
I hope this helps you as much as it helped my students.

## About Style Tiles

Here you will find the most basic example of a Style Tile to work with Sketch 3 
and above. [Sketch](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/).
